I’m Auli Viidalepp, a last year PhD student at the University of Tartu, Estonia. My background is in semiotics and my thesis focuses on the cultural representations and beliefs about technology, specifically the concept of artificial intelligence. I have written articles about [robots in science fiction](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349919165_Representations_of_robots_in_science_fiction_film_narratives_as_signifiers_of_human_identity), [GPT-3 and its public reception](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366987824_Sociocommunicative_functions_of_a_generative_text_the_case_of_GPT-3), and [the semiotic functioning of synthetic media](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369304924_The_semiotic_functioning_of_synthetic_media). The wider goal of my work is to reveal how knowledge is socially constructed and how discoourses borrow meanings from any available cultural ‘repositories’ for a novel or complex idea (such as AI or technology in general). These repositories include myths, (science) fiction, folklore, and animistic beliefs in almost every kind of discourse, including the scientific ones.

In 2023, I founded a research network called [Technosemiotics](https://technosemiotics.net/). Every 3rd Monday, we host a [seminar *What technosemiotics can do?*](https://technosemiotics.net/what-can-technosemiotics-do/), discussing various topics at the intersection of technology, society and semiotics. [You're welcome to join!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/technosemiotics-seminar-tickets-627927156027)
